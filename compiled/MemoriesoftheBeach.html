<h3>Memories of the Beach</h3>
<p>The wet sand was warm under his feet.  He looked back at his solitary foot prints. It used to be two sets. A stranger stumbling upon them could see the closeness of the tracks. They would know two people left them there holding hands.</p>
<p>A gentle wind blew from the ocean. He imagined it whispering his name. It always spoke in her beautiful voice. Quietly the wind spoke the words he yearned to hear from her, I love you. A sharp pain ripped through his chest. Tears blurred his vision.</p>
<p>He stopped to look out over the ocean. This was the place where he confessed his undying love for her. She laughed when he stumbled over the words.  She kissed him, his heart soared. She loved him.</p>
<p>They came here often for picnics or just to be alone together. This was the one little spot on the whole wide world that was theirs.  A secret spot containing all their memories.</p>
<p>Memories. He had so many of them, but so many more were slipping. Every day he struggled to rember her smile, her laugh.</p>
<p>He drew a circle in the wet sand with his cane. It was here that he knelt on one knee, placed the ring on her finger and asked with as much confidence as he could muster to marry him. She couldn’t answer him, only shake her head yes while tears streamed down her lovely cheeks.</p>
<p>The tide rolled up to his feet washing away his circles in the sand. Like so many memories easily lost in time. He sighed.  Good memories and bad.</p>
<p>Carefully he lowered himself down to sit. He tired easy these days. It wasn’t so long ago that he had ran along this beach. Or maybe, it has been. He couldn’t remember the last time he ran on the beach.</p>
<p>The funeral was beautiful. So many people joined him in saying goodbye to her.  The brilliant colors of the flowers were a stark contrast to the occasion. Tears were shed in anguish, but some laughter of a funny story shared by all that loved her.</p>
<p>She was loved. He loved her.  She loved him.</p>
<p>The sunset was as brilliant as the flowers. The beautiful red and orange hues. How she loved the sunset here.</p>
<p>Tired, so tired. He closed his eyes to rest. He needed to rest more everyday.</p>
<p>The breeze caressed his cheek like she did at the hospital. If he kept his eyes closed he could see her smiling. She was brave that day. More than him.</p>
<p>He whispered I love you and she whispered back. The gentle kiss on his lips made him smile.</p>
<p>“Come rest with me”, the breeze spoke in her voice. He smiled, “Yes, my love”.</p>
<p>They walked hand in hand down the beach.</p>
