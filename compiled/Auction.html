<p>Hello dear reader.  We have all seen those crazy TV shows auctioning off storage units.  Have you ever wondered, just maybe, if something not so normal was in them?
<hr>
<p>“Ok, folks.. This one is bare, so we’ll start em off at a hundred dollars”, the auctioneer started the bidding.
</p>
<p>It was an usual day.  Camera crew standing around filming the usual buyers and a few curious stragglers with the auctioneer increasing the price with each yep, here and grunt.  The only oddity was the strange couple.  A man and a woman dressed in bright colored shirts and oddly mismatched color pants.  They both wore wrap around dark sunglasses.  They had been walking with the rest of the on lookers but never bidding on anything.  They all knew the on lookers weren’t going to win, the usuals were set to buy all of the lots.
</p>
<p>“Yep”, came the first bid.
</p>
<p>“150? 150?”
</p>
<p>“One thousand.”  The auctioneer stumbled a bit.  It was the strange man.  Everyone become quiet.
</p>
<p>“OK! Then one thousand one hundred?”
</p>
<p>“Thousand hundred”, yelled the more obnoxious buyer.  He enjoyed running the numbers up on everyone and then backing out leaving them with a overly priced unit.
</p>
<p>TV Flash to an interview with the obnoxious buyer.
</p>
<p>“Yep, I lika to run them numbers up.  Strangers should know better than to mess with me on ma turf. Make em sweat before I pull.  Yeeha!”
</p>
<p>End interview and back to auction.
</p>
<p>“Two thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“Two K ana hundred one.”
</p>
<p>
“Three thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
The crowded gasped and then chucked.  They knew the obnoxious buyer would run the numbers as far as he could.
</p>
<p>
“Three K ana hundred one.”
</p>
<p>
“End this now”, hissed the strange female.
</p>
<p>
“Hmm, three thousand two hundred”
</p>
<p>
TV flash to an interview with the obnoxious buyer.
</p>
<p>
“Feeling the heat! Boy!”
</p>
<p>
End interview.
</p>
<p>
“Three K three hundred.”  “Three thousand four hundred.” “Three K five.”  There was a long pause.  The auctioneer started the countdown.  “Three thousand six hundred”
</p>
<p>
“Ahm out.  Boy you bought you a pricy locker. Nothing but one crate.”, he laughed as he walked away.
</p>
<p>
The two strange people approach the auctioneer.  He hands the clerk seven bundles of a thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>
“Sir, I can take the money later and give you change.”
</p>
<p>
“Keep it”, the stranger growled in annoyance.
</p>
<p>
Both enter the storage unit and close the door behind them.  Everyone laughs or shrugs and go on to the next unit and the next possible treasure.
</p>
<p>
“I hate humans”, the strange man spat.
</p>
<p>
“I agree, but we now have it.”
</p>
<p>
“It was clever of the thief to hide the stolen emperor jewels on this backward planet.  We would have never had searched here.”
</p>
<p>
They open the chest to show a golden crown decorated with various unearthly jewels.  Stored with it are various pieces of splendidly crafted necklaces and charms.
</p>
<p>
“Now the we have seen this place, we shall add it to the next conquest.  Remind me to find the obnoxious one.  His head will adorn my trophy room.”
