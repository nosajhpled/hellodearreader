<div class="story">
I topped my speed at 120
Scream'n down on I-64,
I'm in a hurry to get home.
Switching lanes and passing
Old people driving to slow.
Hit a good stretch and hit the gas
And some dude shot right past.
He didn't sparkle like vampire,
So he could be crazy;
Or he could be insane,
But I'm sure he's like me,
And needs to go bad!
